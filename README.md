# CPU-Scheduler

The project on CPU Scheduling involved the implementation and simulation of six scheduling algorithms to efficiently allocate computational resources to various processes. We tackled algorithms such as First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Round Robin (RR), Priority Scheduling (PS), and Priority Scheduling with Round Robin (PS with RR).
